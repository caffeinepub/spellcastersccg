# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the current draft version live without changing functionality or UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Publish the existing frontend and Motoko single-actor backend per frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md.
- Apply deployment configuration/steps only, without modifying app behavior, screens, styling, copy, or UX flows.

**User-visible outcome:** The current draft build is accessible live in its current form, with no functional or UI changes.
