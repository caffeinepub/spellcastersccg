# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Find People” item from the authenticated app header navigation UI on both desktop and mobile.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “Find People” entry from the signed-in desktop header button group.
- Remove the “Find People” entry from the signed-in mobile slide-out navigation menu.
- Keep all other navigation items (Feed, My Profile, Requests, Notifications, Settings) unchanged and in English.

**User-visible outcome:** Signed-in users will no longer see “Find People” in the app’s header navigation on desktop or in the mobile slide-out menu, while all other navigation items remain available.
